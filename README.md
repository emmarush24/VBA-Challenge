Weekly Challenge 2: VBA
Attatched is the code for three modules. The code is not submitted in a singular module due to processing speed.
The first module creates a list of nonrepeating ticker names that is matched with the yearly change and the percent change of the stock.
The second module creates the total volume associated with the stock.
The third module formats the yearly change column to indicate if there was a net positive or net negative change in the stock.
